# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (Python)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Python projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/python-data2table
  cd python-data2table
  python python-data2table.py
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal/Console*
